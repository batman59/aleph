Our Mission
Astronium was founded on the core belief, that software solutions of the 21st century should be 3 things: Flexible, Affordable and Simple. In other words, we set out to change the predominant paradigm, that software needs to be complex in order to be flexible and that that in itself precludes it being affordable. So our endeavor would have to be considered a recipe for disaster by traditional standards. But just like the Bumble Bee, that should not be able to lift its body into the air and fly, well at least not by the laws of aerodynamics, as far as we understand them today, we did not care about the naysayers and managed to pull off exactly what we set out to do: Enable our clients, to simply create flexible and affordable software based on our frameworks and platforms.
​
​

That’s all there is to our story. Just the desire to create a better environment for software development, that leads to a superior product, enabling innovation from just about any source on a global scale.

Yours,

Daniel, Karim and Joseph
